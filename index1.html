<section id="about-me">
<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>My name is Dr. John Bartholet, and I’m thrilled to help you achieve optimal health and wellness!</p>
<p>Born and raised in Omaha, I graduated from Creighton Prep High School and went on to earn a Bachelor of Science in Biology from Creighton University in 1997. I’ve spent years in the health field, starting at my family’s pharmacy, where I learned the importance of health, nutrition, and holistic wellness.</p>
<p>I received my Doctor of Chiropractic degree from Cleveland Chiropractic College in 2002, where I also served as a teaching assistant. Continuous learning is crucial, so I regularly attend seminars to stay updated on the latest chiropractic care techniques.</p>
